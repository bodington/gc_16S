==========================
Input filename: 01_data/00_input/7_5_0-1_R1.fastq.gz
Trimming mode: paired-end
Trim Galore version: 0.6.6
Cutadapt version: 4.1
Number of cores used for trimming: 1
Quality Phred score cutoff: 20
Quality encoding type selected: ASCII+33
Adapter sequence: 'X' (user defined)
Maximum trimming error rate: 0.1 (default)
Minimum required adapter overlap (stringency): 1 bp
Minimum required sequence length for both reads before a sequence pair gets removed: 20 bp
All Read 1 sequences will be trimmed by 19 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases
All Read 2 sequences will be trimmed by 20 bp from their 5' end to avoid poor qualities or biases (e.g. M-bias for BS-Seq applications)
Running FastQC on the data once trimming has completed
Output file will be GZIP compressed
